# Bug Fix Summary: Selection vs. Neutral Evolution

## 🎯 Bug Identified
**Problem**: `fitness_function=None` was assumed to give "neutral evolution" but actually gives **additive selection**.

## 🔍 What Was Happening
- `fitness_function=None` → Uses `additive_fitness()` → fitness = sum of 1s in genome
- This means individuals with more 1s (beneficial alleles) reproduce more = **SELECTION**
- The "neutral" cases were actually under stronger selection than the "selection" cases!

## ✅ The Fix
For **true neutral evolution**: Use a fitness function that gives equal fitness to all individuals.

```python
def neutral_fitness(population):
    """TRUE neutral evolution: all individuals have equal fitness"""
    return np.ones(len(population.genomes))
```

## 📋 Summary of Changes Made

### 1. New Test File: `tests/test_selection_behavior.py`
- **Critical test**: `test_additive_vs_neutral_fitness_evolution()`
- **Selection ordering test**: `test_selection_strength_ordering()`
- **Proper heterozygosity tests** using true neutral evolution
- **These tests catch this exact bug automatically**

### 2. Corrected Analysis Notebook: `analysis/corrected_simulation_analysis.ipynb`
- Clean demonstration of the corrected understanding
- Proper comparison: TRUE neutral vs. additive selection vs. weak selection
- Shows expected pattern: neutral < additive ≤ weak selection

## 🧬 Biological Insights
- **Additive fitness IS selection** - not neutral evolution
- **True neutral evolution** requires equal reproductive success for all individuals
- **This explains the confusing original results** where "neutral" showed more fitness increase than "selection"

## 🧪 How to Use Going Forward
```python
# For TRUE neutral evolution (no selection)
sim = Simulation(..., fitness_function=neutral_fitness)

# For additive selection (fitness = sum of beneficial alleles)
sim = Simulation(..., fitness_function=None)

# For custom selection
def custom_selection(pop):
    return 1.0 + selection_coefficient * additive_fitness_values
sim = Simulation(..., fitness_function=custom_selection)
```

## ✅ Verification
Run the test to confirm the fix:
```bash
python tests/test_selection_behavior.py
```

Expected output:
```
TRUE neutral fitness change: 0.00
Additive (fitness_function=None) fitness change: 4.50
✅ All tests passed!
