# Glossary

**This glossary defines key terms and concepts used in the Evolution Simulator project.**

---

**Allele**  
A variant form of a gene at a particular position (locus) on a chromosome.

**Asexual Reproduction**  
Reproduction without the fusion of gametes, typically resulting in offspring genetically identical to the parent.

**Crossover**  
A genetic operator that combines genetic material from two parent genomes to produce offspring.

**Fixation**  
The process by which a particular allele becomes the only allele at its locus in a population.

**Fitness**  
A measure of an individual's reproductive success, often determined by a fitness function in simulations.

**Genome**  
The complete set of genes or genetic material present in an organism or simulated individual.

**Heterozygosity**  
The presence of different alleles at a gene locus within an individual or population; often used as a measure of genetic diversity.

**Mutation**  
A change in the genetic sequence, often modeled as a random change in one or more positions in the genome.

**Population**  
A group of individuals of the same species (or simulated entities) considered together for evolutionary analysis.

**Selection**  
The process by which certain individuals are chosen to reproduce based on their fitness or at random.

**Sexual Reproduction**  
Reproduction involving the combination of genetic material from two parents, typically via gamete fusion.

**Tournament Selection**  
A selection method where a subset of individuals is chosen at random, and the fittest among them is selected as a parent.
